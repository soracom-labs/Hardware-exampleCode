    Dependent Modules
    Arduino : by Arduino LLC, subject to the GNU Lesser General Public License.  This library is available in the Arduino IDE and also at https://github.com/arduino/Arduino

    Info on the Grove device at https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/...
    SIM28
    
    EXAMPLE NOTES
    1. Install the Grove GPS device on to the SERIAL slot on the Arduino MKR Connector Carrier board
    2. Make the USB connection between the Arduino MKR 1400 your Arduino IDE (PC)
    3. Use the Arduino IDE to verify and upload the Arduino image to the MKR GPS 1400, you may need to install additional libraries from the IDE (CTRL SHIFT I) to verify the sketch.
    4. Start the serial monitor, the serial connection speed is set by SERIAL_SPEED at 9600 bps
    
    A. The GPS device attached through Serial1 will emit data every second.
      $GPGSA  : Used to represent the IDâ€™s of satellites which are used for position fix. 
      $GPGSV  : Satellite information about elevation, azimuth and CNR 
      $GPRMC  : Time, date, position, course and speed data. 
      $GPGGA  : Time, position, and fix related data of the receiver
    B. The content (value) of a 'static' variable persists, for example value of 'tsStart' persists between calls to the 'timerExpired' function, the value of the variable is initialized the first time the function is called and retains its value between calls.
    C. The 'F("STRING")' construct places static data into flash storage, preserving RAM for your code.
